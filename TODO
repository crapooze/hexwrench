- rename to something more correct
* weka-explorer:
- get sizes of relationships
- when there are more than one relationship pointing to one kind of resources,
  an header for each of them is created, not sure it's what we want, example:
    class Foo
      relationship :bar_1, :Bar, ...
      relationship :bar_2, :Bar, ...
      relationship :foo, :Foo, ...  #similar for looping relationships
    end
- when following relationships recursively, there may be loops in the relationships graphs,
  we do not check this, not sure if it feasible in an efficient, general purpose, way
