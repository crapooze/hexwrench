= HexWrench

== Weka
HexWrench comes with a Weka layer, which goal is to turn Welo::Resources in
weka.core.Instances.

=== Requirements

To use it, you need:
- JRuby
- A recent Weka JAR on your $LOAD_PATH

=== Usage

See example/extended.jar to have a usage sample.

=== Important
Weka supports "related" relationships.
Current HexWrench implementation partially works:
- it works as expected for one level of relationship
- in the case of 2nd and more levels of relationship,
  it will create a new header (i.e., Attribute from Instances) 
  per related object. Although this might be the expected behaviour in some
  cases, it is not the "least-surprise" behaviour, future versions may change 
  this
- it breaks when there are "loops" in the relationship graph
As a conclusion, DO NOT use more than one level of relationships unless you know
Weka very well and had a look at the source.

== R
Upcoming.
